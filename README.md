PHP Laravel Translation Plugin
This plugin allows you to update translations of multiple languages in a single window. Once a mutation is done, it will display a preview. This preview can then be saved. The saved result will be sorted alphabetically.


To use this plugin, simply press the newly added tab from the icons on the right. It will look for translation in the default laravel resource folder and display the translations in the side window. This window can be expanded if so desired.
